It is designed to give students an elementary understanding of the concepts and materials used in the production of paintings. Students will be encouraged to experiment with and respond to materials; develop an awareness of visual perception and intuitive sensibilities; and see painting as a self-reflexive ongoing practice, which links into their major area of study. The student will achieve this by making paintings using various media and supports. Advanced projects are negotiated with students with a greater experience in the subject.",

Every lecture of this course is structured to start with an environmental issue, then bring the “need to know and understand” the relevant chemistry principles.  Through this approach, this course introduces the concepts of chemical measurements, chemical bonding, chemical thermodynamics, chemical equilibrium and organic chemistry into a relevant environmental context with the broader perspective. This course will be run in parallel with the laboratory course to understand the general concepts of measurements, uncertainty and thermochemistry. This structured approach will enable you to develop and practise independent learning skills. This course will also give you an appreciation of scientific methodology and enable you to develop those problem-solving and critical-thinking skills necessary to analyse and discuss chemical and physical phenomena in the environment.",

This is as true in relations between nation-states as in relations between organizations, corporations, and individuals. You as the student will learn and apply skills based on proven diplomatic practice that will assist in formulating effective, ethical, and sustainable approaches to negotiations and deal-making, while developing sensitivity both to international and local cultures. The course moves from the study of negotiation concepts and skills to an appreciation of versatile strategies in complex negotiations, involving multilateral and bilateral partners, issues, and agendas. You will explore a series of case studies in negotiations and agreements in a transnational context. The mastery or failure of the art of negotiation can and often does have profound ramifications in the real world.",

Using Michel Foucault’s ‘Archaeology of Knowledge’ as a point of departure, the course works to initially set up these accumulations to enable an excavation to be conducted in the pursuit of ‘phenomena of rupture, of discontinuity’ between and within these accumulations. Leaving behind the concept of history as a conservative, linear narrative constructed of ‘stable structures’ and ‘vast unities like centuries and periods’ we bring our interest instead to ‘interruptions whose status and nature vary considerably’.",

However, because students will be entering this program from a variety of backgrounds (i.e., fourth year programs at other institutions &amp; from disciplines other than psychology &amp; disability studies) the unit incorporates some remediation of basic design, analysis, and methodological concepts. The fundamental aim of the unit is to provide higher degree students - both research and coursework - with the methodological skills necessary for them to carry out independent research. Throughout the year, methodological and design considerations are integrated with statistical techniques. Statistical theory is not emphasised; instead, students are trained to be consumers and users of statistics. Applied linkages are developed through the extensive use of the SPSS data analysis package. Although the majority of students enrolled in the course are postgraduate psychology students, the course is applicable to any student carrying out applied human research that involves quantitative design and analysis. Examples are drawn from a range of discipline areas.",

Initially the subject will address how an organisation works, how change effects organisations, the most common types of organisational change, as well as management tools and techniques required as an organisation passes through various stages of the change cycle. Building on this background, the subject provides leadership models and techniques for developing and sustaining a creative, visionary and successful project team. The concepts introduce the selection of a leadership style appropriate for a team performance context, how to build trust between team members, how to truly empower others, and how to manage the conflicts that arise over task performance and interpersonal issues. In particular, attention will be given to these issues in the context of engineering/technology based organisations. Where appropriate, examples and case studies of change management and leadership styles in managing change are used. The course may be considered in three elements; the foundations of organisations (2 and 3), strategy and planning change (4 and 5) and topics of implementation of change in corporations and how to manage it (modules 6 to 11).",

Instead, governments are said to have the capacity to play an active role not only in deciding whether an issue will be regarded as a social problem to be dealt with, but also whether an issue will emerge in the consciousness of the community.  In a democracy, where governments must contest regular elections, public policy changes can maximize public support for the incumbent.   Implicit in this contention also is the possibility that governments can deliberately manufacture social problems and propose corresponding policy solutions for political ends.",

In Australia and elsewhere, racism and racial theories have been closely associated with the destruction of indigenous societies. The science of race and racial difference has changed dramatically over time, in recent decades influenced by genetics research which proved that ‘race’, in a genetic sense, does not exist. Yet, racism continues to reduce life changes and access to opportunities for many groups perceived as racially different from the white-Anglo Australian majority.

It is an invitation to think historically about features of current Australian politics, and an opportunity to probe the collective memory of Australian politics. Crises can be interesting in themselves, as dramatic episodes when passions and conflicts are at their most intense. But they also cast light on longer-term ideas and tensions within Australian political culture. At points of crisis such as occurred in the Depression, or at the time of the dismissal of the Whitlam Government, conceptions of what Australia is, who is part of it, and what it might become, were being debated. In addition to developing a narrative account of these crises, we will also make use of film, biographical and autobiographical accounts and an occasional guest speaker. In looking at what has happened here we will also look at what has happened elsewhere, as this helps to illuminate what might have happened differently here.",

It is also, on a less intellectual level, a forum that brings together students in an effort to build and maintain a sense of shared experience (or should we say shared ordeal!). This is a potentially exciting and rewarding course, offering students a real sense of what contemporary scholarship can be about, but its success is dependent on a very high level of student participation and initiative.

The rights to use real estate assets, because of their long life, immobility and heterogeneous character, are traded in markets that differ significantly from those in which other commodities are traded. The potentially valuable rights to use real property must therefore be evaluated in relation to the economic and political environment in which they exist.

In the realm of urban planning, the management of heritage is often a topic of debate. However, it operates within frameworks that involve assessment and recognition, offering various approaches to safeguarding and acknowledging important sites and locations. This course aims to introduce students to historical and contemporary methods used to recognize and protect heritage, with a specific focus on Australian examples, such as Aboriginal cultural heritage, urban buildings, and heritage landscapes. Participants will gain an understanding of current legislation and frameworks for identifying the significance of heritage and applying protective measures through regulatory systems.

Students will enter middle years settings and research learners’ out-of-school literacy practices, investigating how to mobilise such knowledge within the more formal contexts of schooling. The course looks at developing learners’ reading, writing and speaking capacities, underpinned by a sound understanding of literacy theory. Attention will be given to deepening both students and learners’ inferential reading strategies and improving the quality and clarity of writing. Students will engage in reading and writing and develop a vocabulary to describe the processes of language use. Teacher feedback and evaluation of student literacy practices is also a focus.",

It offers practice in the identification, capture and use of appropriate published Business Intelligence. The third module offers an introduction to knowledge management focussing on the various aspects of knowledge-explicit, tacit and cultural knowledge. The process of how organisations develop processes to capture existing organisational knowledge, develop ways to share this knowledge and use it to develop new strategic directions is examined.Study in this course is via reading of lecture type material with accompanying individual and group activities, case study, group work, problem solving situations, individual activities and set readings",

Public policy is the collection of decisions and instruments used by governments to respond to the diverse and complex mix of social, environmental, economic and cultural problems, issues and circumstances which confront and challenge communities, regions and nations. There are a number of models which attempt to explain how policy making happens which typically adopt sausage factory production or cyclic modes of analysis, reducing policy making to a rational, objective process of steps and stages. Deborah Stone, and others, suggest we use other forms of analysis to understand the paradox and ambiguity of policy making. This course takes Stone’s advice and so is designed develop your policy analysis capacity so that you can engage with the complexity and challenges of developing political responses to a diverse range of often enduring and difficult problems and issues. The course is designed for postgraduate students wanting to develop understanding and familiarity with the ideas, processes and politics of policy making. Within this framework, it is the task of the course to support your development as critically aware policy actors.",

This approach is a system that can be used for assessment purposes, where movement can be observed and evaluated in LMA terms; a system within which movement can be extended and one that provides a descriptive movement language for qualitative movement and dance therapy.",

An important element in catchment planning and management is to be able to determine the condition of the catchment and to determine what factors are contributing to the changing condition of the catchment. The course also examines the relevant legislation that applies to catchment management and how that links with the planning and environmental system and the operation of planning schemes and local government planning at both a strategic and statutory planning level. Catchment management is emerging as one of the most important recent organisational and structural reforms in natural resource management. Victoria is at the leading edge in the preparation of regional catchment strategies and the administrative arrangements to plan and manage at a catchment level. There is increasing integration between natural resource management, integrated catchment management and strategic and statutory planning at the regional and local government level.",

That is, the use of problem solving, extended discussion, student explanations, rich assessment and a range of materials, tasks and activities. However, the research also suggests that systems and schools still face a significant challenge in recognising and dealing with the issues involved in teaching and learning mathematics at this level. ‘Hotspots’ identified by the research suggest that we need to pay careful attention to the ‘big ideas’ in mathematics and foster students’ capacity to critically reflect on their learning. In particular, it would appear that we need to focus on the development of place-value, multiplicative thinking, rational number ideas, and what is needed to help students progress to the next ‘big idea’.",

It is not a \"preface to the main body of the text\", etc. It is structured to deal with key issues, provide logical sequencing, overlapping and re-development opportunities, and to focus the work prior to second semester. Experience has shown that a degree of focus is required on certain aspects of the major project or else they tend to be ’dropped out’ or ’not grasped’.

Throughout a series of themed weekly lectures and tutorials, you will be introduced o a range of key theories and concepts that can be applied as tools to analyse the many practices involved in making fashion. Fashion theory is an interdisciplinary field in academia that seeks to understand what fashion is,what it does and how it works. In doing this, fashion theorists use the work of a range of social, cultural, historical, psychological and philosophical thinkers who may,or may not, have written about fashion themselves. As designers, fashion theory enables us to better comprehend the dynamics of fashion so that we may achieve the critical distance necessary to rethink or change it. Fashion theory therefore enables us not only to understand what fashion is but also what it could be.",

The course also provides extensive coverage of development using popular open source Java tools such as Apache Tomcat, Axis2 and Derby as well as the Eclipse Development Environment. The study of SOAP based Web Services is complemented by coverage of REST based Web Services and ancillary tools such as JDOM and JSON. This course also looks at developing Java based web applications that consume web services using the Java EE Servlet and JSP APIs, which form the basis of the Apache Axis2 implementation and serve to provide a solid foundation for studying other web based frameworks built upon such technologies. Security is also emphasised at both the web server and service level using both tool specific frameworks (e.g. within Tomcat web server) and standards based security as part of the WS-Security protocol.",

How might issues be socially constructed and what are the debates about how meanings are created?  How and why do human beings grow and change over the course of their lives and what factors shape and determine their life chances? In order to answer these questions we will draw on a range of social science and psychological theories which can be used to increase understanding of human development and of the dynamics between the individual and the society of which they are a part. The course requires you to develop analytical skills in examining these theories and to apply them to an understanding of a range of social issues which confront individuals in contemporary society. You will consider how your future professional practice will both influence, and be influenced by, these issues. It is particularly relevant to those working in human services such as psychologists, social work practitioners, youth workers, teachers, educators, community workers and others.

Through a critique of the law the course aims to address the ways that the state operates to regulate, maintain and control the notion of family. The course considers the history of family law in Australia and traces the changing nature of the family and the ways that the law has dealt with that change. Topical issues such as fathers’ rights, same-sex relationships, indigenous concerns and the implications of artificial conception are canvassed. Concepts of parenting and parental responsibilities, children’s rights (including the issue of child abuse), the financial issues relating to separation and divorce, and family reforms are discussed.",

Design agencies and other design practices are under pressure to ensure they remain competitive. At the same time, the revolutionary new design products and services of tomorrow must spring from one source - creative thinking, or more specifically - innovation. It follows that for an innovative idea to be commercialised in a competitive market, the idea must be championed or nurtured. Entrepreneurial approaches often make the success of a new design product or service possible.

You will be given an opportunity to reflect upon, debate and apply this definition in a number of different areas. You will analyse the drivers for the transition to sustainable energy. You will examine the institutional framework that shapes how energy is supplied and used, including institutional barriers to sustainable energy, and will analyse attempts to transform the institutional framework to increase the usage of sustainable energy.",

The Flexible Modelling course provides students the experience and expertise to create flexible computational models for design and prototyping. Students receive skills-based instruction through dedicated three-hour workshops (delivered both in person and online) where they will learn the techniques to create complex three-dimensional forms in Rhinoceros3D software. Students are then introduced to the concept of parametric modelling and learn the basics of visual programming in Grasshopper allowing them to embed intelligence and unprecedented flexibility into their design responses. The course is structured to ensure students are developing their design skills alongside learning more pragmatic software techniques. Throughout the semester students will be undertaking weekly exercises in which they must develop a series of design esquisses using flexible modelling and parametric design principles. Each exercise focuses on a new concept, technique, or geometry type giving student a holistic overview of the capabilities of the tools and how to best apply it to the design process. The culmination of these deliverables is a final design project where students apply the technical learning outcomes they learn week to week on their very own parametric model. This course will serve you in areas of study including but not exclusive to architecture, landscape architecture, industrial design, textiles, jewellery design, automotive design, fashion, new media, public art, design innovation, information technology and much more. It is also the ideal subject for any design practitioner seeking to learn Rhinoceros 3D &amp; grasshopper which are globally recognised as some of the best modelling tools available and used by design professionals worldwide.",

In this major project, master’s students will undertake independent research and analysis, leading to a thesis that details their findings. Students undertaking the program will be given the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills acquired throughout the program to a research project on a significant real-world issue related to sustainable energy.  This thesis will be submitted at the end of the second of these linked courses, that is, Sustainable Energy Design Project II. The first task will be development of a research plan, using as appropriate the methods presented in and outcomes from the course, “Developing and evaluating proposals for sustainable energy systems”.

In this major project, masters students will undertake independent research and analysis, leading to a thesis that details their findings. Students undertaking the program will be given the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills acquired throughout the program to a research project on a significant real-world issue related to sustainable energy.  This thesis will be submitted at the end of the second of these linked courses, that is, Sustainable Energy Design Project II. The research plan developed in the previous course, “Developing and evaluating proposals for sustainable energy systems”, will be followed in the project.

Group work theories will be explored in their application to social work practice with groups in a range of settings. Concern for social justice will provide a philosophical underpinning in the course; critical social work perspectives will provide the overarching theoretical framework with attention to race, gender, culture and other power dimensions in group processes and dynamics. Focus will be on the diversity of groups and group work in practice; planning and evaluating groups; understanding and managing group processes and dynamics; and self-reflective practice in groups.",

Rather than understanding the global economy as being separate from political processes, the course examines the relationship between the two to consider the political, social, and environmental implications of different economic systems and decisions, as these occur in local, global and regional contexts. Key concepts explored include: the role of the state in guiding the economy, privatisation versus state ownership of public services, the global distribution of wealth and poverty, and the sustainability of contemporary capitalism. Several case studies are drawn on to examine these themes, such as global labour migration, the increasing influence of multinational corporations, and emerging threats to environmental security. The course seeks to equip students from a range of disciplinary backgrounds with the critical skills to more deeply understand the breadth of social and political outcomes that emerge from an increasingly integrated global economy.",

These problems can arise via the need to find a best approximation or ‘fit’ to a set of data or to use finite resources equitably and efficiently. Indeed many physical laws are governed by the principle of least action. The solution of such problems often requires the use of modern digital computers and algorithms to approximate a solution. This course gives an introduction to the main ideas behind these algorithms and the mathematical theory underpinning their use. We consider what leads to convergence and efficiency for various algorithms. A modern computer programming language will be used to implement algorithms to illustrate these principles. Skills in formulation and the reformulation of optimization problems will be introduced both in the form of problem classes and specific examples. Certain problem classes have associated with them an efficient solver. Since an efficient solver does not exist for all problems we introduce various heuristics to obtain good approximate solutions for difficult problems. Here we will look at some deterministic, probabilistic and evolutionary methods. These later approaches are often based more on global searches and derivative free methodologies.",

This course is designed to introduce you to psychological theories and research regarding the differences and similarities between women and men and the effects of gender in social situations. This course should assist you to recognize the influence of gender on human experiences and relationships, and that assumptions about gender have real-world consequences. You will learn to understand the complexity and diversity of gendered experiences in the social settings of their own and other cultures. You will examine the ways in which the male - female distinction has been assigned meanings and a significance that have specific implications for almost all aspects of social life, and especially for work, family life, ritual, and leisure. Issues of ’femininity’ and ’masculinity’ go far beyond individual identity and self-concept. To appreciate the personal and political dimensions of gender, you will examine what we know and do not know about the similarities and differences between women and men, the sources of that knowledge, theories or explanations to account for those differences (including the so-called, nature-nurture debate), and the way the knowledge might itself be limited by cultural perceptions of femininity and masculinity.",

The course introduces the underlying physics and the governing equations of fluid dynamics, and the mathematical concepts of the numerical approximations to these equations, through study of the Finite Volume Method. The solution procedure of solving the governing equations of fluid dynamics as a set of discretised algebraic equations are explained through step by step calculations. To further enhance students’ learning, the commercial CFD codes, ANSYS/Fluent and/or ANSYS/CFX , are used to simulate laminar and turbulent flows, as well as Newtonian and Non-Newtonian flows, as these flows are relevant to the professional practices in a wide range of disciplines, such as chemical, civil, mechanical, aerospace, and geological engineering, architecture design, physics, and biology. The use of commercial CFD packages provides students with hands-on practices. Students will learn the process of CFD modelling, including the geometry and grid generation, solution algorithm selection, and results evaluation. The course emphasis is on the development of students’ abilities in applying the fundamentals of fluid mechanics and CFD techniques in solving viscous internal and external flows, ranging from flow of fluids/gases through piping systems to flow of air around an object, such as a building or a motor vehicle.",

This will help you develop the competencies required to become a professional engineer chartered by Washington Accord signatories such as Engineers Australia, Hong Kong Institution of Engineers, and the National Board of Accreditation (India).\nIt is your task to find your engineering work placement/internship position. This task helps you develop a critical career skill: to identify suitable roles and perform well in the application process. You have assessments to complete while you are on your placement. You will write about workplace and professional issues and practices during your placement that will be reviewed by your RMIT supervisor. These will develop your skills to reflect on your success and challenges in the workplace, and to help you to learn from your experience. You will also complete post-placement assessment. These will help you to reflect on the overall learning outcomes from your placement, to identify evidence of your skills and areas for further development. This is a foundation skill for writing outstanding cover letters, a critical part of successful job seeking. Professional Engineering Experience is normally undertaken in the summer vacation between the penultimate and final year of study, but can be earlier or later. This course is flexi term and elective or final year option so you can enrol at multiple times during the year, to match your placement period.\n \n<strong>Acceptable behaviour</strong>\nWhen students undertake WIL activities with industry/community partners, they need to be aware of workplace behaviours and expectations. RMIT rejects all forms of unacceptable behaviour. This applies at all times, including while students undertake WIL placement or project. See the WIL Ready Cred for more.\n \n\nSchedule: For Students enrolled in OENG1203\nTo be eligible to enrol in the Hong Kong offering of this course, OENG1203:\n<ul class=\"bulleted1\">\n<li>you must be enrolled in Professional Engineering Experience before starting, and during your placement</li>\n<li>your placement must be for at least 50 days and not required more than 60 days, undertaken full-time or part-time</li>\n<li>your placement must be engineering work, typical of the type of work undertaken by a qualified engineer.</li>\n<li>you must be supervised by a qualified practising engineer while on placement</li>\n<li>you must not be assessed for this placement in any other RMIT course</li>\n</ul",
